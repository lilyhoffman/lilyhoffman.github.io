This website design is simple yet engaging, with a focus on making everything look clean and easy to navigate. 
The background is a light color, which pairs well with the Arial font, making the content easy to read.
 The headings are centered, giving a balanced look, with h1 and h3 using darker colors to stand out nicely against 
 the light background. The main text is highlighted with a light gray background and dark blue font, surrounded 
 by some padding and rounded edges to give it a friendly vibe, along with a slight shadow that makes it pop off the page.

The buttons are styled with a bright blue color and have a cool effect when you hover over them, turning 
into a darker blue to make them feel more interactive. The contact links follow a similar design with smooth 
transitions, so theyâ€™re easy to spot and use. Images are set to adjust automatically based on the screen size.
 The list of hobbies is framed with a soft blue border, rounded edges, and a small shadow, giving it a casual 
 yet neat appearance. All these little touches help make the site feel welcoming and user-friendly!
